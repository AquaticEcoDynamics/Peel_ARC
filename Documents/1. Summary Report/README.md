### Executive Summary

This document summarises findings from a research project funded by the Australian Research Council and several linkage partners, which was conducted over the period 2016-2019.  Within the context of the PeelHarvey region, the research project sought to provide an evidence-based approach to understand the links between regional catchment development (economic resilience) and the health of receiving estuarine waterways (environmental and ecological resilience). Given its particular history of fundamental ecosystem shifts through both chronic decline and an acute engineered ‘recovery’, as well as its current and forecast climate and development stressors, there is an ongoing urgency for a holistic view of this important socioenvironmental system (SES) that can be used to inform sustainable development.  

The project objectives were to: 
1. Develop indices of estuarine and societal ‘health’ 
2. Establish historical trends and health status  
3. Establish current condition and health status 
4. Build a comprehensive modelling and theoretical framework to power a Decision Support System (DSS) 
5. Explore current and future socio-ecological tradeoffs through scenario assessment 

The project led to numerous detailed technical and scientific reports, which in entirety have significantly advanced our understanding of how the Peel-Harvey estuary works, the surrounding catchment and economy, and how it has changed over five decades. In addition to extensive primary data collection on estuarine condition (hydrology, ecology and biogeochemistry), project tasks also included developing comprehensive environmental models for the catchment and estuary, an econometric model, and a conceptual management framework linking economic activity and environmental quality. This report provides a high-level summary of findings and recommendations suited for the local community and policy-makers.
