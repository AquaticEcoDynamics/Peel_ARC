### Executive Summary
The Source (eWater®) modelling platform was used to develop hydrological and nutrient models for the catchment of the Peel-Harvey Estuary. These models allow the nutrient export delivered to the estuary to be estimated and the major sources of these nutrients to be identified. This allows management actions to be targeted where they will have the most capacity to reduce nutrient export.
The model indicates that the nutrient load from all sub-catchments reaching the estuary is approximately 630 tonnes per year of nitrogen and 60 tonnes per year of phosphorus, averaged from 2006–2015. Additional nutrient loads also flow out to the ocean or are stored in dams. The major sources of nutrients by land-use are, for nitrogen, beef cattle farms (62% of total load), cropping (12%) and dairy cattle farms (6.8%) and, for phosphorus, beef cattle (67%), dairy cattle (8.1%) and horticulture (7.3%).

The catchment model, which was coupled with an estuary response model developed in other components of this ARC Linkage project, was then used to compare a range of scenarios proposed for 2050 by stakeholders across the Peel region. These scenarios encapsulated three different catchment management narratives (termed ‘environmentally optimistic, ‘business as usual’ and ‘environmentally pessimistic/economically optimistic’) under two climate regimes (current climate and 2050 predicted climate). Full details of the catchment model development, calibration and outputs of the tested scenarios relating to (i) land-use change, (ii) nutrient management and (iii) climate are outlined in separate documents detailed in the following report.

### Executive Summary
Shallow microtidal lagoons like the Peel-Harvey Estuary system are particularly sensitive to hydrologic change due to restricted exchange with the ocean. The drying climate trend in the south-west Australian region has been widely reported, though the interaction of the trend in river flow and changes to estuarine hydrodynamics brought about by the Dawesville Cut on estuarine conditions has been complex, and it is necessary to establish implications of these changes for future management of the estuary. This study developed a 3D finite-volume hydrodynamic model to assess changes in estuary hydrodynamics, considering how attributes such as water retention time, salinity and stratification have responded to the drying climate trend the artificial channel over the period from 1970 to 2016, and how they will evolve under current climate projections. Our results show that both have significantly changed the hydrology by comparable magnitudes, and also highlight the complexity of their interacting impacts. Firstly, the artificial channel successfully improved estuary flushing by reducing average water ages by 20–110 days, whilst in contrast the reduced inflow from the catchment (more than 50% since 1970) has had the gradual opposite effect on the water ages, and during the wet season this has almost counteracted the reduction brought about by the channel. Secondly, the drying climate has caused an increase in the salinity by 10–30 psu; whilst the artificial channel increased the salinity during the wet season, it has reduced the likelihood of hypersalinity (>40 psu) during the dry season in the western areas. The impacts also varied spatially. The southern estuary, which has limited connection with ocean through the natural channel, is shown to be the most sensitive to climate change and the opening of the artificial channel. The projected future drying climate is shown to slightly increase the retention time and salinity in the lagoon, and increase the hypersalinity risk in the rivers. The significance of these changes for nutrient retention and estuary ecology are discussed, highlighting the importance of these factors when setting up monitoring programs, environmental flow strategies and nutrient load reduction targets.

### Executive Summary
Long-term monitoring data (from 1970 to 2018) and 3D modelling investigations (of selected years from 1979 to 2018) were integrated to study changes in the water quality and nutrient budgets within the Peel-Harvey Estuary (PHE) in response to varied environmental stressors, including catchment loading, a drying climate trend, and the Dawesville Cut construction. The results showed that (1) there was a declining trend of nutrient inputs from the catchment into the PHE, driven by a reduction in flows and nutrient management measures in the catchment; (2) the role of the PHE system in filtering catchment nutrient inputs has changed due to the opening of the Dawesville Cut (e.g., addition of the Cut on average improved the TN export from 50% to 71%, and TP export from 31% to 49% of annual catchment loading, and the nutrient export via the Cut is about 2–3 times of that through the Mandurah Channel); (3) the PHE system has a significant spatial heterogeneity in water quality in response to catchment loading; (4) the estuary response model well reproduced the nutrient pools and water quality evolution in PHE especially in the post-Cut period, suggesting in its current form it is suitable for assessing management scenarios associated with nutrient load management or climate change; and (5) estuary response functions were developed to simplify models and showed locations near the channels are less sensitive to the catchment inputs, as well as that the Harvey Estuary displays a stronger salinity and phytoplankton biomass response to the catchment inputs compared to the Peel Inlet.
Key Findings:
- A reconstruction of nutrient loads over time, including relative nutrient species partitioning, has shown the long-term reduction in load, but relative stability in flow-weighted inflow concentrations.
- Continual changes in water quality have occurred in the estuary over time, including following the Cut and as well as a long-term response following the reduced flows.
- The high-resolution Peel-Harvey Estuary Response Model has been able to capture water quality variability across regions from rivers to lagoons and channels.
- The model has allowed the reconstruction of spatiotemporal variability in key water quality attributes and processes impacting the nutrient load partitioning within the estuary.
- Zonal budgets were undertaken to identify local controls on carbon and nutrient metabolism, and to determine how these respond to changes in flow and catchment loading.
- The pattern of retention and export has changed over time, following the Cut in particular, but recent changes also due to the reduced inflows.
- The amount of retention is dependent on annual flow, and therefore maybe sensitive to forecast projections due to drying climate.

### Executive Summary
The enrichment of sediments with nutrients and organic matter is a key stressor of the health of the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Its rivers drain extensively cleared catchments and have long brought large quantities of organic matter, fine sediments (mud) and dissolved nutrients, including nitrogen and phosphorus, into the system. These inputs impact the condition or health of the estuarine sediments, including their particle size and porosity, oxygen content and nutrient processing abilities. In turn, these changes can degrade water quality, impact biota that live on or in the sediments, and subsequently, lead to a host of diminished societal benefits from the estuary.
The enrichment and resulting health of the sediments in the Peel-Harvey have long been of interest, with the first intensive surveys conducted in the 1970s and highlighting high levels of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus throughout large parts of the basins. More recently, concern has been growing over the extent and impacts of fine sulfidic sediments, or so-called monosulfidic black oozes. Despite these concerns, two decades have passed since the last broad-scale survey of sediments in the estuary, and the condition of sediments in the estuary’s rivers, in particular, has been poorly documented.

This study aims to address these gaps in our current understanding of sediments throughout the estuary, and particularly to assess the impacts of enrichment on the health of its sediments. Specifically, we describe and test a novel approach (a ‘Rapid Assessment Protocol’ or RAP) for quickly and cost-effectively scoring sediment condition based on its colour, texture and odour, which could be used for future monitoring of sediment health in this system. The accuracy of the RAP was verified by comparing it to various detailed sediment enrichment attributes that we measured from samples collected across the estuary basins and rivers. This report provides a broad summary of our key findings, and is supplemented by a more detailed and technical account in Hallett et al. (2019).

Our findings show that the RAP provides an excellent measure of sediment enrichment and its broader effects on sediment condition throughout the Peel-Harvey, with a particularly high success rate (>88%) of identifying ‘good’ sites with low enrichment. Sediments throughout large parts of the system are moderately to highly enriched with carbon and nitrogen, particularly in the deeper, muddier waters of the Harvey Estuary, which negatively impacts their condition. Sites with low levels of enrichment were typically coarse-grained, well oxygenated sands with little to no odour of hydrogen sulfide, and were mainly found in the shallower, nearshore waters of the basins and the middle to lower reaches of the rivers. In contrast, highly enriched, poor condition sediments were typically oozy, grey/black muds with little to no oxygenated layer and a moderate to strong hydrogen sulfide odour. The unhealthiest sediments (monosulfidic black oozes) were found in the Yunderup Channel, the southeast corner of Peel Inlet and the upper estuarine reaches of the Serpentine and Murray rivers. More detailed investigations of the sediments in navigation channels and other depositional areas in the estuary, using the RAP described here, are recommended to better understand flow-on effects for broader estuary health.

To better assess the ongoing health of sediments throughout the estuary, and how activities such as dredging may impact sediment and broader estuarine health, we recommend that a consistent and regular sediment monitoring program is implemented alongside other environmental monitoring of the estuary. The RAP that we have developed, with its simple scoring system and predictive framework for classifying the sediment condition of any new site, provides a cost-effective tool for such monitoring.

### Executive Summary
The overarching aim of this component of the ARC Linkage Project was to characterise
the source, form and biological controls on nutrient inputs to the Peel-Harvey Estuary.
We achieved this by first assessing the dominant forms of nitrogen and phosphorus
found in the catchment sources (e.g. groundwater, rainwater, wastewater effluent and
soil water) and in the receiving waters (e.g. drains, farm dams, rivers and the estuary
basins).

We then developed isotope-based indicators for the biological transformations that
could limit the downstream flow of excess nitrogen. This approach revealed that (1)
both groundwater and rainwater could bring excess reactive nitrogen to the estuary; (2)
shallow receiving waters like drains and creeks play a critical role in removing excess
nitrogen before it reaches the estuary, and; (3) up to 100% of inorganic nitrogen sources
to the catchment are biologically-removed during downstream transport.

Together, these findings lay the foundation for improved catchment-estuary nutrient
modelling, as well as some directions around drain management that could help
maximise nutrient removal, rather than simply water removal.
