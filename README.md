## Data & Model Repository

This is the **data and models** repository for the Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage Project LP150100451, [**Balancing estuarine and societal health in a changing environment**](https://aquaticecodynamics.github.io/peel-book/index.html).

> 
> The aim of this study was to produce an integrated decision support framework for helping optimise trade-offs between regional catchment development drivers (‘economic resilience’) 
and the heath of the receiving estuarine waterways (‘environmental and ecological resilience’), both now and under 2050 development and climate scenarios.
>
>This study was undertaken within the Peel-Harvey catchment-estuary system in south-western Australia from 2016-2019.

## Contents:
Contained within this repository are the data and model files for supporting the linkage program, catalogued into groups of:
- [Data](https://github.com/AquaticEcoDynamics/Peel_ARC/tree/master/Data): contains data collected during the linkage program or provided by 3rd party in order to facilitate the project
- [Models](https://github.com/AquaticEcoDynamics/Peel_ARC/tree/master/Models): contains configuration and forcing files for the catchment and estuary models
- [Images](https://github.com/AquaticEcoDynamics/Peel_ARC/tree/master/Images): contains images used in this repository for supporting the README files

## Data

Contained within this repository is data collected as part of the linkage program as well as 3rd party data collected in order to facilitate the modelling components.

The data has been catalogued into the following catagories:

- Benthic Macroinvertebrate
- BOM Met
- Fish
- Isotope
- Land Use
- Macrophyte
- Nutrient
- Phytoplankton
- Sediment

Contained within this repository is model files developed during the linkage program, catalogued into two groups:

- Catchment: files for Peel-Harvey catchment modelling
- PHERM (**P**eel-**H**arvey **E**stuary **R**esponse **M**odel): files for Peel-Harvey Estuary hydrology and water quality modelling
