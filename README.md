## Data & Model Repository

This is the **data and models** repository for the ARC Linkage Project:

**Balancing estuarine and societal health in a changing environment (LP150100451).**

_The aim of this study is to produce a predictive decision support framework for helping identify land-planning
solutions that best optimise trade-offs between catchment development aspirations (hereafter ‘societal health’) and estuarine ecological integrity and ecosystem service delivery (together, ‘estuarine health’) in the face of a fast growing population and changing climate._

## Data

Contained within this repository is data collected as part of the linkage program as well as 3rd party data collected in order to facilitate the modelling components.

The data has been catalogued into the following catagories:

- Benthic Macroinvertebrate
- BOM Met
- Fish
- Isotope
- Land Use
- Macrophyte
- Nutrient
- Phytoplankton
- Sediment

The Primary point of contact for the data repository is <a href="mailto:brendan.busch@uwa.edu.au">_Brendan Busch_</a>

## Models

<img src="https://github.com/AquaticEcoDynamics/Peel_ARC/blob/master/Images/Link.png">

The models have been catalogued into two in groups:

- Catchment
- PHERM (**P**eel-**H**arvey **E**stuary **R**esponse **M**odel)

## Documents

The Documents archive contains all of the publically available reports, catalogued into:

- Summary Report
- Chracterising the Environment
- Estuarine Ecological Health
- Economic Health
- Decision Support System & 2050 Scenarios
