## Data, Model & Document Repository

This is the repository for relevant **data, models and documents** for the ARC Linkage Project: 

**Balancing estuarine and societal health in a changing environment (LP150100451).**

*The aim of this study is to produce a predictive decision support framework for helping identify land-planning
solutions that best optimise trade-offs between catchment development aspirations (hereafter ‘societal health’) and estuarine ecological integrity and ecosystem service delivery (together, ‘estuarine health’) in the face of a fast growing population and changing climate.*

## Data

Contained within this repository is data collected as part of the linkage program as well as 3rd party data collected in order to facilitate the modelling components.

The data has been catalogued into the following catagories:

- Benthic Macroinvertebrate
- BOM Met
- Fish
- Isotope
- Land Use
- Macrophyte
- Nutrient
- Phytoplankton
- Sediment

The Primary point of contact for the data repository is <a href="mailto:brendan.busch@uwa.edu.au">*Brendan Busch*</a>

The models have been catalogued into two in groups:

- Catchment
- PHERM (**P**eel-**H**arvey **E**stuary **R**esponse **M**odel)
