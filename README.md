## Data, Model & Document Repository

This is the repository for relevant data, models and documents for the ARC Linkage Project: 

**Balancing estuarine and societal health in a changing environment (LP150100451).**

*The aim of this study is to produce a predictive decision support framework for helping identify land-planning
solutions that best optimise trade-offs between catchment development aspirations (hereafter ‘societal health’) and estuarine ecological integrity and ecosystem service delivery (together, ‘estuarine health’) in the face of a fast growing population and changing climate.*
