## Data & Model Repository

This is the **data and models** repository for the ARC Linkage Project: [**Balancing estuarine and societal health in a changing environment (LP150100451).**](https://aquaticecodynamics.github.io/peel-book/index.html)

> 
> The aim of this study is to produce a predictive decision support framework for helping identify land-planning
solutions that best optimise trade-offs between catchment development aspirations (hereafter ‘societal health’) 
and estuarine ecological integrity and ecosystem service delivery (together, ‘estuarine health’) in the face of a fast growing population and changing climate.

## Contents:
Contained within this repository is the data and model files for supporting the linkage program, catalogued into groups of:
- [Data](https://github.com/AquaticEcoDynamics/Peel_ARC/tree/master/Data): contains data collected during the linkage program in order to facilitate the project
- [Models](https://github.com/AquaticEcoDynamics/Peel_ARC/tree/master/Models): contains model files used in this project for the catchment and estuary models
- [Images](https://github.com/AquaticEcoDynamics/Peel_ARC/tree/master/Images): contains images used in this repository for supporting the README files

<!-- 
## Data

Contained within this repository is data collected as part of the linkage program as well as 3rd party data collected in order to facilitate the modelling components.

The data has been catalogued into the following catagories:

- Benthic Macroinvertebrate
- BOM Met
- Fish
- Isotope
- Land Use
- Macrophyte
- Nutrient
- Phytoplankton
- Sediment

The Primary point of contact for the data repository is <a href="mailto:brendan.busch@uwa.edu.au">_Brendan Busch_</a>

## Models

<img src="https://github.com/AquaticEcoDynamics/Peel_ARC/blob/master/Images/Link.png">

Contained within this repository is model files developed during the linkage program, catalogued into two in groups:

- Catchment: files for Peel-Harvey catchment modelling
- PHERM (**P**eel-**H**arvey **E**stuary **R**esponse **M**odel): files for Peel-Harvey Estuary hydrology and water quality modelling
