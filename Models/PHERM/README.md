# PHERM
## Peel-Harvey Estuary Responce Model

---

The final version, PHERM v11, was run for 16 selected years from 1979 to 2017, including 6 years in the pre-Cut period and 10 years in the post-Cut period, spanning a range of hydrologic conditions for each. Model parameters were set initially in accordance with settings used in similar systems (Bruce et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2019b), but were then adjusted based on detailed comparisons with field data through a process or error assessment. All available data was compiled into 24 Estuary Response Zones (ERZs) and used to identify calibration issues specific to different regions (e.g., rivers vs. lagoons). 

Generally, the model parameter-set was common across all simulations. 
The models output all variables across the domain at 2-hourly internals for each of the 16 annual simulations, and these were also used for nutrient budgeting at the estuary scale, and also in each ERZ. The resultant predictions were also used to develop simpler Estuary Response Functions (ERFs) to illustrate typical patterns of water quality response to flow and nutrient input in different areas of the system.
