### Overview

The PHERM is coupled with the catchment model to study the water quality and ecological habitat changes of PHE under a series of future climate and land management scenarios (Figure 1). The water and nutrient outputs from the catchment modelling created a characteristic set of estuary water quality and ecosystem indicators for each scenario, that has been summarized the scenario chapter of the Linkage project report.

### Model Software

Catchment model: SOURCE catchment model

Hydrodynamic platform: TUFLOW-FV, http://tuflow.com/FV%20Documentation.aspx 

Water quality model: AED2, http://aed.see.uwa.edu.au/research/models/AED/index.html

### Input Data

Inflow rates and its related nutrient loadings produced from the catchment model were used as input data for PHERM.

### Outputs

A series of key hydrodynamic and water quality attributes were produced by PHERM in each scenario, then were then analyzed to produce ecological index for ecological services, including:
-	Hydrology: salinity, temperature, stratification
-	Water quality: carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations, DO, phytoplankton biomass
-	Ecological services: juvenile and adult crab habitats; cyanobacteria and dinoflagellate habitats, Index of water quality
