### Overview

PHERM was run for 16 selected years from 1979 to 2017, including 6 years in the pre-Cut period and 10 years in the post-Cut period, spanning a range of hydrologic conditions for each. The key model settings, inputs, and outputs are as described in the PHERM model folder. The performance of PHE water quality response model in reproducing the estuary states was extensively assessed against data from the regular monitoring sites and also event-based monitoring data, for all simulated water quality attributes (water temperature, salinity, oxygen (DO), total chlorophyll-a (TCHLA), TN, TP, turbidity, ammonium, nitrate, phosphate), and where possible surface and bottom values were individually assessed. The model has been applied with integration of monitoring data for:
-	Identify the seasonal and inter-annual character of water quality changes in pre- and post-Cut periods;
-	Develop the Peel-Harvey Estuary Response Model (PHERM) and evaluate the performance in reconstructing the long-term changes in water quality;
-	Provide a synoptic view of changes to the nutrient budget of the PHE system, including the catchment loading, the estuary retention/assimilation capability, and rates of export to the ocean;
-	Build estuary response functions (ERF) to identify the impacts of drying climate and Dawesville Cut on the changes of key water quality parameters (DO, TCHLA, clarity, nutrient retention);

### Data Collection

A comprehensive data review and compilation process was undertaken to provide the necessary data for model setup, validation and assessment. Available monitoring data was sourced from: Marine and Freshwater Research Laboratory (MAFRL, 1977-2001), Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER) Water Information Reporting (WIR, 2001-2018), Murdoch University biogeochemical field surveys (MU, 2016-2018), and Southern Cross University nutrient and isotope surveys (SCU, 2017). The data from these sources are summarized in Table 1 and sampling locations are shown in Figure 1, and was standardised to facilitate comparison
