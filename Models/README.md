 ## PHERM
 
An estuary water quality response model was developed to gain insights into the nutrient budgeting and regional water quality response to changing environmental inputs. The water quality response model consists of a 3D hydrodynamic model TUFLOW-FV (as described in Huang et al., 2019a), which is dynamically coupled with the AED2 water quality model to simulate the nutrient cycling and key biogeochemical processes (Hipsey et al., 2019). The AED2 water quality modules were configured to simulate the C, N, P, and DO budgets, including resolving the inorganic nutrients and organic matter fractions, and primary production (Table 1; Figure 2). Spatial variation and sediment quality and benthic properties (including biomass of seagrass, macroalgae and bivalves) was also included.  
Key modelled chemical and biological processes include:
-	Water column kinetic (time-varying) chemical / biological transformations (e.g., denitrification or algal growth)
-	Water column equilibrium (instantaneous) chemical transformations (e.g., PO4 adsorption)
-	Vertical sedimentation or migration
-	Biogeochemical transformations in the sediment or biological changes in the benthos
-	Fluxes across the air-water interface
-	Fluxes across the sediment-water interface
-	Feedback of chemical or biological attributes to physical properties of water (light extinction, drag, density)
