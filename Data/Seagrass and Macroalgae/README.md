Data archive for Murdoch University's seagrass and macroalgae sampling throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary.

### Overview

Sampling of the seagrass and macroalgae communities (collectively ‘submerged macrophyte’ communities) was undertaken at 51 sites in both shallow waters (<1.3 m deep) and 
deeper waters (>1.3 m deep) throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary in spring 2017 and autumn 2018 (see map below). Data available at each site on each sampling occasion includes
 the average biomass (g/m<sup>-2</sup>, dry weight) of each macrophyte species present, derived from five replicate core samples.
 
In addition to this contemporary data, data for broad groups of macrophyte taxa (i.e. seagrass, green macroalgae, brown macroalgae, red macroalgae and charophytes) were collated 
from historical sampling regimes undertaken by the Marine and Freshwater Research Laboratory at Murdoch University in each year from 1978 to 2000 and in 2009 at many of the sites 
sampled in 2017-18 (see map below). Macrophytes were sampled in various months in each sampling year, but most commonly during autumn and spring. Available data at each site on 
each sampling occasion includes the average biomass of each macrophyte group, typically derived from five replicate core samples.

1978 to 2018 (red circles=shallow sites <1.3 m deep; blue crosses=deeper sites >1.3 m deep). Additional sites sampled only in 2017-18 are Pe1, Pe2, Ha1, Ha2, Ha3 and Ha4 ([Krumholz, 2019](https://researchportal.murdoch.edu.au/esploro/outputs/graduate/Macrophyte-communities-in-the-Peel-Harvey-Estuary/991005543545007891)).
