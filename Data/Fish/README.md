Data archive for Murdoch University's fish sampling between 2016 - 2018.

Data on the fish communities was collected at 32 sites in the shallows (<1.5 m deep) and 21 sites in the deeper waters (>1.5 m deep) throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary 
in each season from autumn 2016 to summer 2018 (see map below). 

Data available for each replicate sample collected at each site on each sampling occasion includes (i) the abundance of each fish species, expressed as number of fish per 100 m2 
for samples collected in the shallows using a seine net, and number of fish caught per hour for samples collected in the deeper waters using gill nets; (ii) the functional guild allocations 
for each species, reflecting their habitat, feeding mode and use of the estuary (as per Hallett et al., 2012), and; (iii) the individual metric scores, total metric score and overall ecological 
health grade (‘A’, excellent to ‘E’ very poor) for the Fish Community Index devised during this ARC Linkage Project.

In addition to this contemporary data, the same type of information was collated for all fish samples collected historically throughout the estuary by Murdoch University researchers 
in select years between 1979 and 2014 (Potter et al. 1983; Loneragan et al. 1986, 1987; Young and Potter 2003a, b; Valesini et al. 2009; Veale 2013, Potter et al. 2016). 
All historical fish abundance data were standardised to the same density or catch rate used for the contemporary data to minimise, as far as possible, the effects of different 
sampling gear used in different studies.
