### Overview

Data on the concentrations of various groups of phytoplankton were collected by the DWER at various sites throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary in 2008. 
Measurements of the corresponding nutrient and physical conditions were also recorded. The collated data set comprises:

- Concentrations (cells/mL) of each phytoplankton group
- Concentrations of various nitrogen and phosphorous species at the surface and bottom of the water column
- Corresponding physical profiles (e.g. conductivity, temperature, DO, pH, Secchi depths) 
- Chlorophylls
- Concentration of chlorophylls a, b and c and Phaeophyta
