Data archive for Murdoch University's sediment mapping Peel-Harvey Estuary.

---

A wide-scale sediment collection program was undertaken across 97 sites throughout the estuary during November-December 2016, comprising 62 sites in the basins (Peel Inlet and Harvey Estuary) and 35 sites across the estuarine reaches of the Serpentine and Murray rivers (Fig. 2).
At each site, two replicate, intact sediment cores were collected using a corer with a detachable, transparent PVC tube (600 mm long and 60 mm in diameter). The intact cores were then briefly stored in the dark until processed as described below. Water depth (m) was also recorded at each site.
