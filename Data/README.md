# Data

### Overview

The datasets that supported ARC Linkage Project LP150100451 [Balancing estuarine and societal health in a changing environment](https://aquaticecodynamics.github.io/peel-book/index.html) have been collected by multiple organisations across hundreds of different sites within the Peel-Harvey estuary or catchment, spanning 1970 to 2018.

While most data is included in the archive, some data are available upon request as either the data collected during the project is yet to be published, or the data was collected outside the project and is not publicly available. Please contact the listed person for more information (see respective archives for contact details).
