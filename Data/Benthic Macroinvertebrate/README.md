### Overview

Data archive for Murdoch University's benthic macroinvertebrate sampling in the Peel-Harvey Estuary.

Data on the benthic macroinvertebrate community was derived from sediment cores collected at 60 sites throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary in winter 2017 and summer 2018 (see map below).

Data available at each site on each sampling occasion includes (i) sediment core information (geographic location, water depth, sediment penetration depth, sediment depth of the oxic layer and 
Rapid Assessment Protocol [RAP] sediment condition class ([Hallett et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1039/C9EM00141G))); (ii) the density of each macroinvertebrate species and their associated taxonomic classification, 
feeding group and bioturbation type ([Queirós et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.769)), and (iii) the score and corresponding ecological health grade (‘A’, excellent to ‘E’ very poor) for the benthic macroinvertebrate 
community as determined by the Estuarine Benthic Community index devised during this ARC Linkage Project.
