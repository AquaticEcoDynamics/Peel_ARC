### Overview

The 2011 land-use mapping dataset from [Kelsey et al. (2011)](https://www.wa.gov.au/government/publications/hydrological-and-nutrient-modelling-of-the-peel-harvey-catchment-2011) was updated to 2015, 
and was informed by the state cadastre dataset (Landgate), aerial photography, upper storey vegetation calculated from LIDAR (Department of Water and Environmental Regulation) 
and native vegetation data (Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development) (see Fig. 1 below). The land-use mapping update focused 
on the inclusion of new urban developments, large-scale changes to agricultural land-uses and practices, intensive agriculture 
and riparian zone revegetation.
