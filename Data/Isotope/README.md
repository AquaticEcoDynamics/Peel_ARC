Data archive for Southern Cross Univeristy isotope sampling in the Peel-Harvey Estuary, 2017 - 2018.

### Overview

We collected samples from both receiving waters (defined as surface waters in the catchment and estuary) and N and P sources 
(defined as soils, fertilisers, and the non-surface waters that could directly flow to the surface water). 
This sampling design enabled us to build a biogeochemical understanding onto the known hydrologic flow paths linking ‘sources’ 
and ‘receiving waters’ and avoid extraneous or duplicate sampling. For instance, we sampled soil water (which could directly leach 
into creeks, drains and rivers), but not the nitrogen fertilisers and livestock excreta that are applied to these soils.

The location of all sampling points is shown in the map below, with most being sampled in both summer (February–March 2017) and winter (July–August 2017). 
In addition to the above sampling of sources and receiving waters, high-resolution temporal sampling (24 h continuous measurements) 
of different forms of nitrogen were carried out at two estuary locations (Figure 5.2) in winter 2017 to assess how tides impacted their distributions.
