Data archive for Southern Cross Univeristy isotope sampling in the Peel-Harvey Estuary, 2017 - 2018.

---
### Overview

Samples were collected from both (i) receiving waters (defined as surface waters in the catchment and estuary, including feeder drains, farm dams, creeks, 
main drains and the estuary rivers and basins) and (ii) nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) sources (defined as soils, fertilisers, and the non-surface waters 
that could directly flow to the surface water, such as groundwater, rainwater and storm water), at multiple locations in summer (February-March) and winter (July-August) 2017 (Fig. 1).

Data available for each sample includes (i) sample collection information (e.g. geographic location, date, time and, where relevant, other physico-chemical 
parameters such as dissolved oxygen, salinity etc); (ii) concentrations of different N and P species, and (iii) the isotopic composition of the inorganic species.

In addition to the above sampling of sources and receiving waters, high-resolution temporal sampling (24 h continuous measurements) of different forms of 
nitrogen were carried out at two estuary locations (see Fig. 1 below) in winter 2017 to assess how tides impacted their distributions.
