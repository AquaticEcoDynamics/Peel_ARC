### Overview

Data on the nutrient concentrations within the water column were collected at multiple sites throughout the Peel-Harvey Estuary from 1970-2018, as outlined below and shown in Fig. 1.


#### 1. 1977 - 2001; Data collected by the Marine and Freshwater Laboratory: 

Weekly data on the concentrations of various nitrogen and phosphorous species were recorded by MAFRL at the surface and bottom of the water column at 6 sites within the Peel-Harvey Estuary between 1977 and 2001 (Fig. 1).

> [!NOTE]
> Data is available upon request. Data contact:  [Mr. Krzysztof Wienczugow](mailto:k.wienczugow@murdoch.edu.au)


#### 2. 2001 - 2018; Data collected by the DWER ("WIR Data 2001 - 2018.mat"): 

Nutrient concentration data recorded at monitoring sites throughout the estuary between 2001 and 2018 (Fig. 1) by the DWER has been collated from their [Water Information Reporting system](https://wir.water.wa.gov.au/Pages/Water-Information-Reporting.aspx).

The data is contained within a Matlab formatted **.mat** file and only contains a subset of sites and variables of the available nutrient and flow data that are relevant to this project.

> [!TIP]
> Once loaded into Matlab the data contains the structure of ***data.{site}.{variable}***, with properties of site coordinates(X,Y), date, depth, and units
>
